                    I was looking for scholarships because I did not hear from the Indian institution I applied to due to the covid-19 pandemic 
                    that started. I saw an advertisement about a school that is inspiring to raise young African leaders and I started reading 
                    about it because I was curious to know more. <br>
                    I took the test that I saw after reading and later received an email talking about how they like my drive and passion.
                    I felt this is an institution that has been able to identify the needs of an individual through a test. And so, i decided to apply to study there <br>
                    It has always been my dream to help the people in my community and country at large, so after reading the dreams and goal of the school, 
                    I realized I have found an institution that can help me achieve my dream and even give me better ideas on how to do it. <br>
                    The application process was not that difficult to follow, the various instructions that was given made it easier to apply. <br>
                    I was so excited and happy when I got an email informing me about my admission. It was like a dream come true.

                  <h3 class="mt-5">Life At ALU</h3>
                  <p>
                    Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, we had to travel to Mauritius in January, 2021 instead of September, 2020.
                    It was quite a fascinating situation because we had to do some few lessons online from September to December, 2020 where 
                    learnt about certain things of ALU and how to use learning materials provided by the institution. <br>
                    I had to be in quarantine in a country i had no idea about and it was suffocating especially because of the inability to go out and explore the place.
                    After the quarantine for 2 weeks, I was able to meet other students and we were transported from the hotel to the school. <br>
                    Seeing the school for the first time was not what i expected. 
                    Because I was attending a university, which was the biggest in Ghana, I was a bit disaapointed about the spaces but seeing the facilities and structures
                    was wonderful and the interactions I had with various students was more welcoming than I thought. <br>
                    From starting classes, the facilitators had a welcoming face and encourages us by helping whenever we needed them.
                    We had leassons on Leadership Core with courses such as Data & Decisions, Communicating for Impact, Enterpreneurial leadership which gave me lessons on 
                    how to be a leader with empathy and projects which gave me an opportunity to work on real life situations with my peers. <br>
                    My advice to prospective is that they should embrace themselves for self learning and also make good use of all the opportunities given to them.

              <h3>Social Life</h3>
              <p>
                I can sometimes be seen as a boring person because I love to be by myself either watching a movie or doing some basic stuffs.
                So far I have tried to become more sociable rather than being an introvert. <br>
                Most people tend to think I am an introvert and others too an extrovert.
                I love spending time alone and doing things that excite me the most. 
                But I have some social life that includes both personal and professional interactions.
                I see it as an element of learning, joy, self-fulfillment and personal resilience.
                I love working as a team with my peers groups and friends because I see it as a way of learning from people.
                I spend time with friends, example friends with the same interest as me.
                I love to listen to people so I can hear diverse ideas of people about life.
