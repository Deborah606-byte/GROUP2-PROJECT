        Hi, I am Deborah Ama Paintsil, a computing student of the
        African Leadership University, Mauritius <br />
        I am dynamic and creative person who loves nature and passionate
        about things that makes me grow.

      <p>
        I am a Ghanaian and I am from the Central Region of Ghana but I
        reside in Ashaiman, a district in the Greater Accra Region. <br>
        I can say I'm about 1.5m tall and weigh 60kg, which was a total shock to me <br />
        My father's name is Robert Mensah Paintsil and my mom is Mercy Mensah Paintsil.
        I am the 3rd of their six children. I love beans with red oil and fried plantain
        I love watching movies, singing and reading.
        I stay closer to a water body called the Ashaiman Dam. The community I reside in is a suburb
        of Ashaiman called Jordan Village. Life at Jordan Village is not a bed of roses.
        I wish to be a role model to most of the ladies and girls in my neighbourhood because of
        how events turn out in our lives during growth. Some gets pregnant before they complete Junior High school
        whiles others learn to trade and get married after they complete Senior High School. <br>
        I am a past student of the Tema Methodist Day Senior High School, Ghana. I was offering
        Bsc Mathematical Sciences in the University of Ghana, Legon and stopped in my 2nd year to continue schooling in
        Mauritius.

      <h5 class="card-title  ">My country</h5>
      <p>
        Ghana was the First Sub-Saharan Country in Africa to Gain Independence.
        One of the fascinating historical facts about Ghana is that it achieved complete independence for the first time
        in Sub-Saharan Africa in 1957.
        Ghana was created by joining the Togoland trust with the former British Gold Coast area. <br /> <br><br>

      <h5 class="card-title  ">Historical Places in Ghana</h5>
      <img src="../IMAGES/Kwame.webp" alt="Kwame Nkrumah" class="img-fluid">
      <p>
        On the site of a former British polo field where Ghana's independence was proclaimed in 1957, <em>Kwame Nkrumah
          Memorial Park</em>
        was constructed.
        The Mausoleum, a majestic marble monument, serves as both the final resting place for Fathia Nkrumah and the
        first President of Ghana.

      <img src="../IMAGES/Elmina.webp" alt="Elimina Castle" class="img-fluid mt-4">
      <p>
        <em>Elmina Castle</em> which was built in 1482 by Portuguese conquerors is one of the best preserved forts along
        the
        Ghanaian coast. After first being a
        camp for weapons and resources such as gold and ivory it became a depot for slaves when the slave trade
        massively increased towards the end of the 17th century.

        Tucked away in the Assin Attandanso Reserve is the <em>Kakum National Park and Canopy Walkway</em> that offers
        visitors
        spectacular scenery and a fascinating wildlife experience
        along with modern camping facilities. The park’s best-known feature is undoubtedly its 7 suspension bridges
        which form a 333-meter long canopy walkway, suspended up to 27 meters above the forest floor from trees that are
        over 300 years old. <br><br><br>

      <img src="../IMAGES/ALU1.jpg" class="img-fluid ALU1" />
      <p>
        I was looking for scholarships because I did not hear from the
        Indian institution I applied to due to the covid-19 pandemic
        that started. I saw an advertisement about a school that is
        inspiring to raise young African leaders and I started reading
        about it because I was curious to know more. <br />
        I took the test that I saw after reading and later received an
        email talking about how they like my drive and passion. I felt
        this is an institution that has been able to identify the needs
        of an individual through a test. And so, I decided to apply to
        study there <br />
        It has always been my dream to help the people in my community
        and country at large, so after reading the dreams and goal of
        the school, I realized I have found an institution that can help
        me achieve my dream and even give me better ideas on how to do
        it. <br />
        The application process was not that difficult to follow, the
        various instructions that was given made it easier to apply.
        <br />
        I was so excited and happy when I got an email informing me
        about my admission. It was like a dream come true.
      </p>
      <h5 class="card-title py-3">Life At ALU</h5>
      <p>
        Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, we had to travel to Mauritius
        in January, 2021 instead of September, 2020. It was quite a
        fascinating situation because we had to do some few lessons
        online from September to December, 2020 where learnt about
        certain things of ALU and how to use learning materials provided
        by the institution. <br />
        I had to be in quarantine in a country i had no idea about and
        it was suffocating especially because of the inability to go out
        and explore the place. After the quarantine for 2 weeks, I was
        able to meet other students and we were transported from the
        hotel to the school. <br />
        Seeing the school for the first time was not what i expected.
        Because I was attending a university, which was the biggest in
        Ghana, I was a bit disaapointed about the spaces but seeing the
        facilities and structures was wonderful and the interactions I
        had with various students was more welcoming than I thought.
        <br />
        From starting classes, the facilitators had a welcoming face and
        encourages us by helping whenever we needed them. We had
        leassons on Leadership Core with courses such as Data &
        Decisions, Communicating for Impact, Enterpreneurial leadership
        which gave me lessons on how to be a leader with empathy and
        projects which gave me an opportunity to work on real life
        situations with my peers. <br />
        My advice to prospective is that they should embrace themselves
        for self learning and also make good use of all the
        opportunities given to them.

      <h5 class="card-title  ">Social Life</h5>

      <p>
        I can sometimes be seen as a boring person because I love to be
        by myself either watching a movie or doing some basic stuffs. So
        far I have tried to become more sociable rather than being an
        introvert. <br />
        Most people tend to think I am an introvert and others too an
        extrovert. I love spending time alone and doing things that
        excite me the most. But I have some social life that includes
        both personal and professional interactions. I see it as an
        element of learning, joy, self-fulfillment and personal
        resilience. I love working as a team with my peers groups and
        friends because I see it as a way of learning from people. I
        spend time with friends, example friends with the same interest
        as me. I love to listen to people so I can hear diverse ideas of
        people about life.
        I have loved to talk to friends and interact more with them because of
        the friends I made when I started studying in Mauritius. I actually love to make
        friends.

      <h5 class="card-title  ">Life In Mauritius</h5>

      <p>
        Mauritius, a wonderful place to be. I can say it is a lovely place to be.
        Been a Ghanaian, I honestly do not appreciate the food of Mauritians.
        Getting to Mauritius, during the first week in quarantine, I could not eat any of their foods
        except junk foods like pizza, burger and wraps prepared for us. <br />
        I would have loved to travel across Mauritius these past 1 and half years I hace been there
        but I never got the chance to do these traveling except going to the beaches, which are beautiful
        places one will love to be because of the beautiful scenery and the waves. I loved to chance sit there
        to enjoy the waves of the sea.
        Studying in Mauritius has also given me the opportunity to do part time works which I never got the opportunity
        to do in my home country. I was able to work 20 hours a week.
        Although staying alone can be quite expensive, working whiles studying helped me a lot. <br>
        My life in Mauritius has been good so far and wonderful, I had an experience of staying alone and
        making important decisions that affects my life. <br>
        Not forgetting the Mauritians who made staying in their country wonderful. Although there were some bad
        encounters
        with some of them, the good ones made it lovely.
        These are some lovely places I will like to visit before I graduate African Leadership College and leave
        Mauritius.

      <h5 class="card-title  ">Ideas For the Future </h5>

      <p>
        I have always had so many plans and ideas for the future. Growing up in an under developed community in Ashaiman
        and seeing how young girls in my community end up forfeiting their futures because of pregnancy,
        I knew I must do something for this community. It has always been sad to see girls in the same age group as mine
        giving heed to pressures and getting pregnant at the end.
        Those who made it to high school either drop out at the end or complete with poor grades which do not allow them
        to further their studies in the University or Polytechnic. <br />
        <br>
        After realising these ordeals, I decided to come up with something that can benefit both my society and other
        communities who are facing these issues. I came up with idea of opening an IT firm that will give all
        young ladies adequate skills and most current skills needed in the Technological world this century and beyond.
        I will also create an organization where young girls will have the opportunity to be encouraged on daily basis
        either through incentives,
        books or stipends which can help to better the grades of those who are in the high school. <br>
        <br>
        I also decided on creating an organization which will teach and train every young person some handy work skill
        such as knitting of bags, clothes, beads making and other skills that can help reduce the rate of unemployment.
      </p>
      <h5 class="card-title py-3">Ideas for Career</h5>
      <p>
        I want to be a software engineer or website developer and also I want to be an international business woman.
